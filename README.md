### ML Certificate Materials

This repository contains material I completed for the University of Washington's Certificate in Machine Learning. It includes class assignment jupyter notebooks and quizzes.

### intro_ML

Includes assignment jupyter notebooks from Introduction to Machine Learning, Fall 2021. The Intro course was mostly review for me and revolved around core ML concepts and foundational algorithms, including regression, classification, and unsupervised methods. The notebooks mostly use scikit-learn, but we also used XGBoost and mlxtend.

### advanced_ML

Assignment notebooks and quizzes from Advanced Machine Learning, Winter 2022. This course moved to advanced methods such as ensemble methods, gradient boosting, and suport vector machines, as well as specialized topics like natural language processing and recommendation systems. 

The notebooks include my own basic implementations of a decision tree, KMeans clustering, and a support vector machine.
